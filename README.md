# AccessMap Dashboard - Pedestrian Walkways Centrality Visualization

[AccessMap Github Repo](https://github.com/AccessMap)

A visualization of AccessMap pedestrian walkway data (sidewalks + crossings) that displays the edge-betweenness-centrality of each pedestrian walkway within a selected bounding box.

The UI is built using AccessMaps GL JS, and the backend API is built using Python's Flask and NetworkX.
